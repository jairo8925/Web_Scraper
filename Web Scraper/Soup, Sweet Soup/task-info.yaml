    A series of videos from the Zhurong Mars rover have been released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA), including incredible footage showing 23 seconds of the rover’s perilous descent to the surface.The clips — published on 27 June, almost halfway through Zhurong’s three-month mission — represent a “terrific bunch of data,” says David Flannery, an astrobiologist at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who is part of the team working on NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover.Zhurong arrived on 15 May after being released by the Tianwen-1 orbiter. One of the videos (below) captures the rapid deceleration of the lander encasing the rover before it settles on the surface of Mars. It shows a parachute being deployed and released, followed by a view of the ground as the lander approaches the surface.




    Hum of motors on MarsOne week later, on 22 May, Zhurong rolled off a ramp on the landing platform. In another video (below), this moment is recorded in black and white — and also by a microphone that picks up the hum of electric motors and the creak of wheels rolling down the metal ramp.Flannery says the sounds from Zhurong are intriguing because Perseverance also has a microphone, and the researchers are trying to correlate audio it detects with data from the rover’s weather station to study wind patterns.That was not part of Perseverance’s goals at the mission outset, but “these sort of serendipitous scientific investigations will also be possible with the Chinese rover”, he says. “We often find that we make accidental discoveries and can use our instruments in unforeseen ways.”




    Flannery argues that it might be possible to use microphone data from both rovers to compare the wind patterns in two regions of Mars — Zhurong is in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars’ northern hemisphere, whereas Perseverance is several hundred kilometres away in Jezero crater.Furthermore, the Chinese team might find the microphone useful for troubleshooting engineering problems that emerge with the rover, as NASA engineers also hope to do in the event of a problem, he says. In the third week of its mission, on 1 June, Zhurong dropped a wireless camera on the ground, and then retreated to take a self-portrait of itself and the lander. That feat is now documented in footage of the rover reversing and manoeuvring into place (below).




    Decent distance so farAccording to the CNSA, the rover has so far clocked up at least 236 metres on Mars, which Flannery says is a considerable distance for a nation’s first mission. NASA’s inaugural Mars rover, Sojourner, which landed in 1997, only traversed some 100 metres over its lifespan.Zhurong seems to be heading southwest, towards where the parachute from its descent landed, which would be a target of interest, says Xiao Long, a planetary geologist at the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan. Inspecting the integrity of the parachute could also provide useful insights for designing future missions, say researchers. Long hopes that the rover will stop en route to make scientific observations of a sand dune along the way.Zhurong seems to be in great working order and will by now have collected some scientific data, Long adds — but that information has yet to be released by the CNSA. Scientists say they are eagerly awaiting data from Zhurong’s many scientific instruments, including its ground-penetrating radar, and its cameras and spectrometers for analysing rocks.

    Preliminary results from a landmark clinical trial suggest that CRISPR–Cas9 gene-editing can be deployed directly into the body to treat disease.The study is the first to show that the technique can be safe and effective if the CRISPR–Cas9 components — in this case targeting a protein that is made mainly in the liver — are infused into the bloodstream. In the trial, six people with a rare and fatal condition called transthyretin amyloidosis received a single treatment with the gene-editing therapy. All experienced a drop in the level of a misshapen protein associated with the disease. Those who received the higher of two doses tested saw levels of the protein, called TTR, decline by an average of 87%.

    CRISPR gene therapy shows promise against blood diseases
    The treatment was developed by Intellia Therapeutics of Cambridge, Massachusetts and Regeneron of Tarrytown, New York. They published the trial results in The New England Journal of Medicine1 and presented them at an online meeting of the Peripheral Nerve Society on 26 June.Previous results from CRISPR–Cas9 clinical trials have suggested that the technique can be used in cells that have been removed from the body. The cells are edited and then reinfused back into study participants. But to be able to edit genes directly in the body would open the door to treating a wider range of diseases.“It’s an important moment for the field,” says Daniel Anderson, a biomedical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. “It’s a whole new era of medicine.”Treating the untreatableTransthyretin amyloidosis is caused when molecules of TTR protein fold into the wrong shape and clump together, forming fibres that interfere with organ function. The disease principally attacks the heart and nerves. A hereditary form of the condition affects about 50,000 people worldwide; more than 100 mutations in the TTR gene have been linked to transthyretin amyloidosis.The condition can cause heart disease, pain and death, and until recently there was little that doctors could do to treat it. “It’s an absolutely awful disease,” says Julian Gillmore, a nephrologist at the Royal Free Hospital in London who has treated people with various forms of amyloidosis for about 25 years. “Up until a few years ago, I just watched them get worse and die.”But transthyretin amyloidosis has become a prime target for new medical technologies that aim to disable disease-causing genes. It is definitively linked to production of a particular protein — shut down production of that protein, and disease symptoms stop progressing and in some cases reverse.

    CRISPR treatment inserted directly into the body for first time
    In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration approved two drugs to treat transthyretin amyloidosis, both of which reduce the production of TTR by targeting the messenger RNA that encodes it. But although these drugs reduce TTR by about 80% and prolong survival, they must be taken routinely to keep TTR levels down, and do not always halt disease progression. Most TTR protein is produced in the liver, an organ that readily soaks up medicines from the blood. That feature is key: although CRISPR–Cas9 has been hailed as a revolutionary way to treat diseases, it has limitations. The technique requires a DNA-cutting enzyme, called Cas9, and a piece of RNA, called a guide RNA, to direct it to the proper place in the genome. These must be packaged in a way that shields them from degradation, and must be delivered to the site in the body where they are needed.Intellia encased RNA molecules coding the guide RNA and the Cas9 protein in nanoparticles made of biomolecules called lipids, which can be taken up by the liver. The guide RNA sends Cas9 to snip the TTR gene; the cell’s DNA-repair processes then mend the break, but often make mistakes that can disable the gene and halt production of the TTR protein.A month after treatment, TTR production was reduced in all participants. In one person who received the higher of the two tested doses, it fell by 96% — a result that Gillmore, who was an investigator on the trial, finds particularly exciting. Current treatments can reduce TTR by as much as 80%. But he says that a therapy that knocks TTR production down further would increase the chance that his patients’ symptoms would stop getting worse — and might even lead to improvement.“When you get to numbers like 96%, that’s where you start to give the body a chance to clean up what has been deposited,” says John Leonard, president of Intellia.Bone marrow and beyondResearchers will anxiously await data from more participants, says Anderson, and will want to know how all the participants fare over a longer period of time. But the current results are enough to fuel hope that CRISPR–Cas9 will one day be able to help treat not only transthyretin amyloidosis, but other conditions, too.

    Quest to use CRISPR against disease gains ground
    Intellia has also shown that it can deliver CRISPR–Cas9 components to cells in the bone marrow in mice. Leonard says the company is keen to develop a method of treating sickle-cell anaemia that doesn’t require the arduous and risky bone marrow transplant used in ongoing gene-editing trials for the illness.Another company, Editas Medicine in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has encoded CRISPR–Cas9 components into a disabled virus. Editas is testing this in people with a hereditary disorder that causes blindness, but the virus must be injected directly into the eye, where the gene editing needs to take place.Techniques for delivering CRISPR–Cas9 components to various parts of the body are advancing rapidly, says Anderson. “The list keeps growing,” he says. “I’m optimistic that we’re going to see much broader application of genome editing.”

  text: "People with Parkinson's disease often undergo various types of therapy to\
    \ improve their motor function.Credit: Amelie-Benoist/BSIP/Science Photo Library\n\
    \n\nThe recent controversial approval of the Alzheimer’s drug aducanumab by the\
    \ US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has raised the possibility that the agency\
    \ could now be more willing to fast-track treatments for a swathe of neurodegenerative\
    \ diseases — illnesses that have so far thwarted drug developers. But an independent\
    \ advisory panel fiercely questioned the new drug’s effectiveness, and researchers\
    \ are divided on whether the potentially smoother approval path that aducanumab\
    \ has paved will really deliver useful therapies for people with conditions such\
    \ as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’\
    s disease.Drug developers including Amgen, in Thousand Oaks, California, and Pfizer,\
    \ based in New York City, have shut down their neuroscience programmes in recent\
    \ years because of the difficulties of finding successful treatments for brain\
    \ diseases. So Eric Siemers, a drug development consultant in Zionsville, Indiana,\
    \ thinks aducanumab’s approval could bring renewed investment and innovation.\
    \ \n\nLandmark Alzheimer’s drug approval confounds research community\nOn the\
    \ basis of conversations he has had with investors and clients, he says the tide\
    \ is already turning. “There’s a lot more interest now in research in neurodegenerative\
    \ diseases,” says Siemers, who is also chief medical officer of the Alzheimer’\
    s disease company Acumen Pharmaceuticals in Charlottesville, Virginia. Acumen\
    \ filed paperwork for an initial public offering just days after the approval\
    \ of aducanumab.Some advocacy groups are also encouraged, on behalf of desperate\
    \ patients with few or no therapeutic options. “If the FDA can find a way to be\
    \ flexible for Alzheimer’s, maybe they can find a way to be flexible for ALS,”\
    \ says Neil Thakur, chief mission officer at the ALS Association.But many researchers\
    \ fear that this regulatory precedent puts false hope above solid clinical science,\
    \ and harms patients in the process. “Folks who are considering this approach\
    \ should take a deep breath and a cold shower,” says Fyodor Urnov, scientific\
    \ director of the Innovative Genomics Institute at the University of California,\
    \ Berkeley, and a former drug hunter at Sangamo Therapeutics in Brisbane, California.“\
    I don’t want a future where we have multiple prescribable medicines. I want a\
    \ future where we have multiple prescribable medicines that work.”Reading between\
    \ the linesAducanumab — developed by the biotechnology firm Biogen in Cambridge,\
    \ Massachusetts — followed an unusual route to approval. In March 2019, Biogen\
    \ halted two phase III trials of the drug candidate after an interim analysis\
    \ showed that it was unlikely to improve cognition for people with mild Alzheimer’\
    s. But when Biogen re-evaluated the data and found that a subset of people in\
    \ one of the trials might have benefited, it reversed course; the firm submitted\
    \ aducanumab for approval in 2020.\n\nIs ‘friendly fire’ in the brain provoking\
    \ Alzheimer’s disease?\nThe FDA’s eventual decision to ignore the advice of it\
    \ advisory committee and approve the drug, it says, was based on aducanumab’s\
    \ ability to lower levels of amyloid plaques in the brain — protein clumps that\
    \ some scientists think cause Alzheimer’s.Instead of granting the drug a standard\
    \ approval, which is typically reserved for agents that have demonstrated benefit\
    \ for people in large phase III trials, the FDA opted to use its ‘accelerated\
    \ approval’ pathway. This is for treatments that are “reasonably likely”, but\
    \ not certain, to help patients.The agency has embraced this pathway in cancer,\
    \ using results from small phase II trials to green-light drugs for narrow sets\
    \ of patients with late-stage disease. With aducanumab, the agency has shown that\
    \ it is willing to push the paradigm to a broader set of patients. One reason\
    \ that decision has attracted criticism is that decreased levels of amyloid plaques\
    \ are an unvalidated and contentious marker of a drug's activity.In large trials\
    \ of other Alzheimer’s drug candidates, amyloid lowering has not led to cognitive\
    \ benefits, and this has made it a sticking point for researchers.\n\nThe red-hot\
    \ debate about transmissible Alzheimer’s\nBiogen can now sell its US$56,000-per-year\
    \ drug to 6 million Alzheimer’s patients at all disease stages in the United States.\
    \ As a condition of the accelerated approval, the firm has until 2030 to report\
    \ the results of a ‘post marketing’ trial to prove the drug’s cognitive benefit.Internal\
    \ memos released last week by the FDA shed some light on the decision. Clinical\
    \ reviewers argued that aducanumab is likely to provide a cognitive benefit, whereas\
    \ statistical reviewers said the data did not support approval.Asked by Nature\
    \ to elaborate on the implications for Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease\
    \ and ALS, an FDA spokesperson replied that “the FDA stands ready to work with\
    \ research communities and drug developers to study more therapies for Alzheimer’\
    s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders”.Patrizia Cavazzoni, a high-ranking\
    \ FDA official, has given a nod to aducanumab’s broader impact. “The accelerated\
    \ approval pathway has been an incredibly useful tool in oncology,” she said in\
    \ a press meeting. “We believe it serves as a model that we hope can be replicated\
    \ with neurodegenerative diseases.”Silver linings?One neurodegenerative condition\
    \ whose treatment could benefit from aducanumab’s approval is Parkinson’s disease,\
    \ which affects an estimated one million people in the United States. Although\
    \ approved drugs help to alleviate the symptoms of this disease, none of these\
    \ slows its progression. For Joseph Jankovic, a neurologist at Baylor College\
    \ of Medicine in Houston, Texas, a more flexible approach to drug development\
    \ could speed up progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe protein α-synuclein builds up in deposits\
    \ like this one in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease.Credit: J. J.\
    \ Hauw, ISM/Science Photo Library\n\n\nThe approval of aducanumab “is one of the\
    \ worst decisions the FDA has ever made,” says Jankovic, who is unconvinced that\
    \ the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. But accelerated approval does have value\
    \ for drugs that offer better hints of efficacy, he argues. “I’m always looking\
    \ at a glass half full. I hope that this will soften the FDA when they review\
    \ drugs for other diseases.”He has his eye on drug candidates that mop up α-synuclein,\
    \ a protein that builds up in the brains of people with Parkinson’s.A recent phase\
    \ II trial of an α-synuclein-targeted antibody called prasinezumab failed to make\
    \ an overall dent in the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, Jankovic explains, but\
    \ it delayed the worsening of people's tremors, stiffness and slowness of movement.\
    \ Drug-development partners Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, and Prothena,\
    \ in Dublin, have since launched a larger phase II trial to look at the motor-function\
    \ benefits of the drug candidate.Results are expected in 2023, at which point\
    \ this programme could test the FDA’s resolve in relation to neurodegenerative\
    \ diseases. “In my view, if the phase II study is positive, the FDA should seriously\
    \ look at the approval of this drug,” says Jankovic, an investigator in trials\
    \ of the antibody and a consultant to Prothena.Regulatory goalpostsHuntington’\
    s disease — an inherited neurodegenerative disease that causes involuntary jerking\
    \ movements and dementia in 30,000 people in the United States — is another one\
    \ to watch. People with this condition carry a mutant, toxic form of a protein\
    \ called huntingtin (HTT), so researchers have developed drug candidates to lower\
    \ its levels.The most advanced of these had been tominersen, developed by Roche\
    \ and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, which lowers mutant HTT in the cerebrospinal fluid\
    \ by 44%. Tominersen entered a phase III trial in 2018. Roche stopped that trial\
    \ early, in March of this year, after patients worsened on treatment.\n\nAre infections\
    \ seeding some cases of Alzheimer’s disease?\nHTT-lowering drugs are not yet out\
    \ of the running, however. Candidates that target other forms of HTT might still\
    \ slow the disease. And if Roche’s ongoing analysis of the tominersen data identifies\

    A detailed analysis of satellite and remote-sensing data has uncovered poor conditions at the Wai Khar jade mine in northern Myanmar, where a landslide last July killed more than 170 people.The international team of authors behind the study1 — the first to rigorously document a mining accident in Myanmar — say the results suggest that mismanagement and poor design contributed to the tragedy, not simply monsoon rains, as was initially assumed.As well as shedding light on the causes of the disaster, which have not yet been fully resolved, the authors hope the findings will aid documentation of mine collapses and improve site planning — both in Myanmar and in other countries that see frequent mining accidents.Mining of jade, largely for jewellery and carvings destined for China, has exploded in Myanmar in recent years. About 400,000 miners scavenge jade from the slopes of open-pit mines, often with little safety equipment. They feed an industry that supplies 90% of the world’s jade and earned an estimated US$8 billion in 2011 — 20% of the southeast Asian state’s export revenue.Hundreds of deathsThe jade industry in Myanmar is poorly regulated and mine collapses are common, causing many hundreds of deaths since 2004, according to the study authors. But a lack of transparency from the Myanmar authorities — together with political and ethnic conflict in northern Kachin state, where jade mining is centred — means field surveys of mine sites are “nearly impossible”, the authors argue.

    Quake-prone Myanmar leads the way in seismic monitoring
    In what is thought to have been Myanmar’s worst mining disaster, in June last year rain began to saturate the ground at the northern section of the Wai Khar open-pit jade mine in the region of Hpakant. Eventually, on 2 July, a huge volume of quarry slope materials “collapsed into a flooded open pit, burying and killing at least 172 jade miners”, write the authors.Although mining companies in Hpakant had been ordered by the authorities to suspend operations from 1 July for three months for the monsoon season, impoverished freelance scavengers were still hunting for unpicked jade exposed by rain. Heavy rainfall was initially assumed to be the trigger for the collapse.Myanmar's National Human Rights Commission blamed the landslide on the lack of due diligence and risk assessment from mining companies — at least 12 of which owned licences covering specific parts of the Wai Khar mine at the time of the accident. But non-governmental organizations say that a lack of regulatory oversight from the government in the mining industry is also a major problem endangering the lives of miners in Myanmar.

    A spokesperson for Myanmar Gems Enterprise — the Myanmar government-owned regulator and issuer of mining licenses — told Nature that mining operations at the Wai Khar open-pit mine ended on 29 June before the accident, and that a government investigation concluded rainfall had infiltrated the ground via fractures in the rock, leading to the landslide. They added that the research findings will be valuable for assisting in future governance of the mining sector.The mining companies either could not be reached for comment on the study, or did not respond to Nature’s queries on the causes of the disaster.Given the lack of access to mine sites in Myanmar, a team of researchers from Taiwan, Singapore, Brazil and Thailand used data from remote sensing and satellites to investigate the collapse. These are often used to monitor mine sites in nations that have strict mining regulations. “There are a lot of things we can do from space,” says study co-author Wang Yu, a geologist at National Taiwan University in Taipei.Aggressive mining cyclesTo look for deformation in the landscape around the Wai Khar mine over time, Wang and his team combined online video footage of the accident from the ground with aerial and satellite data, as well as historical data from a NASA space-shuttle mission in 2000.The authors found two factors that they think triggered the wall collapse, in addition to rainfall. Firstly, the walls of the mine were dangerously steep given the weak nature of the rock surrounding the pit. Google Earth images captured at intervals between 2013 and 2020 indicated periodic landslides had occurred in the pit, even where special steps had been dug out of the wall to prevent collapse, Wang says.“The mining site is under aggressive mining cycles that are exacerbated by frequent, uncontrolled landslides,” he and his co-authors write. This process allows jade to be extracted more quickly, but creates dangerous conditions.“The argument that the slope was too steep is very likely to be correct,” says Dave Petley, a geographer who studies landslides at the University of Sheffield, UK. He says he can’t be sure the landslide was associated with mining practices, but that operations should be designed to prevent deformation. “The authors show that the mine walls were actively deforming before failure,” he adds.Poor mine designSecondly, the study authors say that piles of mine waste acted like a sponge for rainfall or groundwater, and probably gradually leaked water that eroded the walls of the pit, aiding its collapse. The waste piles, detected in digital elevation data from NASA’s space shuttle in 2000 and Japan's Advanced Land Observing Satellite from 2006–2011, shouldn’t have been so close to the mine, they say.

    How do natural hazards cascade to cause disasters?
    In an e-mail to Nature, the authors said that “there are issues of mismanagement and bad design in the pit”, but stop short of blaming anyone for the collapse. “Our analysis is only from the scientific viewpoint. It should be considered as an autopsy report, not a criminal complaint,” they said. “A thorough investigation will be needed in order to determine the correct share of responsibility among different parties.”Kyi Htun, an independent mining geology consultant in Myanmar’s capital, Yangon, says that after reading the study, he thinks that poor site management — such as not monitoring how the slope changed over time and not disposing of waste properly — probably played a part in the accident. “No one has done mine design properly,” at the Wai Khar mine, he says.Assisting other nationsSan Htoi, a spokesperson for advocacy group Kachin Women’s Association Thailand, who visited the mine after the landslide, also says the findings are consistent with her observations: “The slope is too steep. It’s so dangerous.”The authors of the study say they hope that the team’s work will encourage other scientists to perform similar analyses in nations where mining is poorly regulated. Between 2004 and 2016, mine accidents led to deaths in 32 countries, according to one report2.As for the latest study, “It is a very comprehensive analysis of the mining accident,” says Birendra Bajracharya, coordinator of SERVIR-Hindu Kush Himalaya in Kathmandu, an international initiative that uses geospatial technologies to inform responses to environmental challenges. “The methodology will be useful to other researchers,” he adds.Study co-author Yunung Nina Lin, a geologist at Academia Sinica in Taipei, says she hopes “the families of those who died can have a chance to learn about what had been happening on the mining site over the years”, and that “those in power can take the messages from this research and transform them into real actions.”
